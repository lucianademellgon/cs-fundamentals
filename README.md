# Python Computer Science Fundamentals 

A curated collection of algorithmic problems and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) projects implemented in Python. This repository demonstrates my progression from basic logic to structured software design.

This repository consolidates my coursework and personal implementations of core Computer Science concepts using Python. 

It serves as a portfolio of **academic mini-projects** demonstrating my ability to translate theoretical logic into functional software.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Apply **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in practical scenarios.
- Solve complex algorithmic problems with optimized logic.
- Demonstrate clean code practices and modular design.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.3
- **Focus:** Clean Code, OOP Principles (Inheritance, Polymorphism), and Logic.

## 📂 Content Highlights
- **OOP Projects:** Simulations of real-world systems (Banking, Inventory) using classes.
- **Data Handling:** Algorithms for matrix manipulation and string processing.
- **Logic & Control Flow:** Optimized solutions for mathematical problems (Primes, Fibonacci).
