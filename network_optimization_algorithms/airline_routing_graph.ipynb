        "## 📋 Project Overview\n",
        "A routing system designed to model global flight connectivity. This module uses a **Directed Graph** architecture where airports are nodes and flight paths are weighted edges.\n",
        "It demonstrates fundamental algorithms for pathfinding and network traversal.\n",
        "\n",
        "### ⚙️ Technical Specs\n",
        "* **Data Structure:** Adjacency List (Implemented via Python Dictionaries).\n",
        "* **Graph Type:** Directed & Weighted (Flights have direction and duration/cost).\n",
        "* **Key Algorithms:**\n",
        "    * **DFS (Depth-First Search):** For connectivity checks.\n",
        "    * **Pathfinding:** Logic to determine route availability.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔍 Usage\n",
        "The `FlightNetwork` class allows for dynamic route establishment and queries like *\"Is there a connection between JFK and Tokyo?\"*, simulating the backend logic of travel booking engines."
