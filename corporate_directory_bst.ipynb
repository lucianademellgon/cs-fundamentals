        "## 📋 Project Overview\n",
        "Implementation of a hierarchical data structure to manage corporate records for the *Ministry of Economy*.\n",
        "This system indexes companies by their **Tax ID (RUT)** using a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** to ensure efficient retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "### ⚙️ Technical Specs\n",
        "* **Data Structure:** Binary Search Tree (Nodes represent Companies).\n",
        "* **Key Algorithm:** Recursive Insertion and Search.\n",
        "* **Time Complexity:**\n",
        "    * Search: O(log n) (Average) vs O(n) (Linear Search).\n",
        "    * Insert: O(log n).\n",
        "    \n",
        "### 🚀 Usage\n",
        "The `CompanyRecord` objects contain metadata (Name, Address, Sector) and are sorted automatically upon insertion based on their numerical ID."
